# Shipping Tracking App

A system where people can enter a shipping tracking code in a form and as a result they will see an estimated delivery date. The frontend is connecting to the backend through a REST API. The data store in the backend can be replaced (by a config). There are two storage solutions that can be plugged in: MySQL and file (CSV).
